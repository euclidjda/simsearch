<h2>What is Euclidean Fundamentals?</h2>

<p>
When looking at potential investments, every good investor mentally
compares the opportunity at hand to investments they have seen play
out in the past.  This process is generally limited to one’s own
personal experiences and knowledge.  Euclidean Fundamentals offers
investors a new capability.  Now, when evaluating investments,
investors can immediately examine outcomes of similar investment
opportunities in history.
