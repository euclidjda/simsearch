<p>Last updated: April 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2013.</p>

<p>Euclidean Technologies knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting the Web site located at www.euclidean.com/fundamentals/ (the “Site”) you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. </p>

<h3>What Personal Information About Users Does Euclidean Gather?</h3>

<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience. Here are the types of information we gather.</p>

<h4>Information You Give Us:</h4>

<p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as providing our services to you, responding to your requests, and communicating with you. Examples of this information include information regarding your company searches, information regarding your custom search criteria, information you provide to establish and manage your account, information you communicate to us by phone, email or otherwise, and information that you provide when you offer us feedback. Such information may include your name, address and phone numbers, credit card information, and other financial information.</p>

<h4>Automatic Information:</h4>

<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses the Site or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of Euclidean on other Web sites. Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type, version, and time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our Web site, including date and time; cookie number; and companies you viewed or searched for. We may also use browser data such as cookies, Flash cookies (also known as Flash Local Shared Objects), or similar data on certain parts of our Web site for fraud prevention and other purposes. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. </p>

<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>

<p>To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from Euclidean if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your <a href="https://www.euclidean.com/account/settings/">Customer Communication Preferences</a>.</p>

<h3>What About Cookies?</h3>

<p>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features on our Site, and personalized advertisements on other Web sites. </p>

<p>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of Euclidean’s essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use any Euclidean services that require you to Sign in. </p>

<h3>Does Euclidean Share the Information It Receives?</h3>

<p>Information about our users is an important part of our operation, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share user information only as described below. </p>

<h4>Aggregated Data:</h4>

<p>We may analyze, publish and share aggregated level data for marketing purposes, including, for example, information identifying the most searched for companies or the commonly used models for evaluating companies. </p>

<h4>Third-Party Service Providers:</h4>

<p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </p>

<h4>Business Transfers:</h4>

<p>As we continue to develop our service, we might sell portions of our operation, or buy other businesses. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless the customer consents otherwise). Also, if Euclidean or substantially all of its assets are acquired, then customer information will be one of the transferred assets. </p>

<h4>Protection of Euclidean and Others:</h4>

<p>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Euclidean, our users, or others. This does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. </p>

<h4>With Your Consent:</h4>

<p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. </p>

<h3>How Secure Is Information About Me?</h3>

<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. </p>

<p>We (or our service providers that handle credit card processing for us) reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming a subscription (but, as may be expected, transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing). </p>

<h3>Which Information Can I Access?</h3>

<p>Euclidean gives you access to a range of information about your account and your interactions with Euclidean for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. <a href="http://www.euclidean.com/fundamentals/account/">www.euclidean.com/fundamentals/account/</a>.</p>
