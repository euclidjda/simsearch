      <p>As a registered user you get to reach the same analysis that anonymous users do. In addition you enjoy the following benefits: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Favorites:</b> We allow you to mark certain searches as favorites and remember them for you.</li>
        <li><b>Sharing:</b> We make it easy for you to share your search results and remember them. 
          Even if you use a complex search method. </li>

        We only remember your mail address and a user name that you would like to use to make our interaction with you more human. 
        We do not take any other information, and we do not share your information with anyone else. 
        You can see our <a href="/privacy"> Privacy Statement </a>
