SimSearch

Ruby on Rails app that is the base application for value based evaluation UI.

* Development

Requirements:

- Ruby 1.9.3, Rails, Web Server

Installation for Mac OSX

Running on Mac OSX, use this tutorial to get yourself going with the right versions of Ruby and Rails.
http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2010/9/23/install-rails-ruby-mac/

Once you verify that you have everything working with this setup on you local machine, you should be ready to go onto our project.  This sample uses sqlite3 already installed on your machine, so you should be good.

At this point, if you go into the root of the project directories and type 'rails s' you should be getting a bunch of missing... warnings.

Package management tool "bundler" version 1.2.0 or higher, which is currently prerelease. See http://railsapps.github.com/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Shortcut is "gem install bundle".. voila! 

After that bundler will manage all the libraries that you need. Just run "bundle install" from the code directory to download everything.

Going to the simsearch root and typing "rails s" or "rails server" will launch the web server. By default the application will be listening on http://localhost:3000
